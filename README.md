# Master-Thesis

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my **Master's thesis** on Vehicle Re-ID called:<br>
_Vehicle Re-Identification through ResNet-based Feature Extraction and Spatio-Temporal constraints: A real-world application in an urban scenario_.

The thesis explores methodologies for detecting, tracking, and re-identifying vehicles across multiple camera views using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## Structure
- `Thesis.tex` – Main LaTeX document.
- `Cap_n.tex` – Individual chapter files for better organization.
- `images/` – Figures and diagrams used in the thesis.
- `bibliography.bib` – Bibliography file containing references.

## Requirements & Compilation
Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as:
- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)

and simply compile the `Thesis.tex` file.

## License
Is a license really needed for a thesis?
